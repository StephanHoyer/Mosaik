Mosik - Node Webframework
=========================

Mosaik is rapid application web framework with node js. It is based on the connect framework. It follows the Modul-Middleware-View principle which is similar to the MVC pattern. The concept is inspired by the great layout processor of the Open source ecommerce solution Magento.
The Framework is based on the idea, that the separation between controller and view isn't as strict as it should be. In most other webframeworks like Ruby or Django the controller prepares data for the view by fetching them from the database (of cause with the help of models). The approach of Mosaik is a little different: there are 4 main entities:
- model: Plays the same role as in other webframeworks
- template: same as model
- Block: prepares data for rendering
- Middleware: Contains the "business logic", parses and processes POST data, interacts with models, handles session and so forth. 
Because every request needs other middleware, not only the template (and the controller as in other frameworks) is request-specific but also the middleware. One middleware is just a simple function with several parameters like request and response.
The block is the "final" middleware which takes the information generated by several middlewares.
A second main feature of Mosaik is the layout- or blocktree. Every website contains several blocks such as the header, containing the menu and the loginstate, the main content (e. G. a blogpost) and a footer (containing a search field and a sitemap).
